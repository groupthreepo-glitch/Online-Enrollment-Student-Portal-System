To install node_modules for your project, you need to use npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn, which are tools that manage dependencies in a Node.js project. Here’s how you can install the node_modules in your code:

Steps to Install node_modules:

Navigate to your project directory:
Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where your project is located.

"cd path/to/your/project"

Ensure package.json is present:
The package.json file should already exist in the root of your project. This file contains all the dependencies your project needs.

If you don't have a package.json file, you can create one by running:

"npm init"

Install dependencies using npm:
If you already have the package.json and package-lock.json files, you can install all the dependencies listed in package.json by running the following command:

"npm install"

This will download and install the required dependencies into the node_modules folder in your project directory.

If you’re using yarn instead of npm, you can install dependencies by running:

"yarn install"

Verify installation:
Once the dependencies are installed, you should see a node_modules folder in your project directory, containing all the libraries and packages.
